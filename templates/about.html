    <h1>About Mental Fitness Tracker</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            The Mental Fitness Tracker is a web application developed as part of my IBM internship project.
            The primary objective of this project is to help users monitor and improve their mental well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our busy daily lives, it's essential to take care of our mental health. The Mental Fitness Tracker
            provides a user-friendly platform where individuals can track various aspects of their mental fitness
            and gain insights into their well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application uses machine learning regression models to predict the user's mental fitness score based
            on a combination of numerical data and textual information provided by the user. The predicted score can
            offer valuable insights into one's mental well-being and serve as a guide to make positive changes in daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that the Mental Fitness Tracker is not a substitute for professional mental health
            advice. If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health issues, please seek support from a qualified
            mental health professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope that this application can play a small role in promoting mental health awareness and providing a tool
            for individuals to take charge of their mental well-being. We appreciate your interest in our project, and if
            you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to contact us.
